# The-Roots-of-a-Quadratic-Equation
The contents of this repository were taken form a lab report I submitted for the course Programing for Engineering.

Problem Statement

There are four main methods for solving quadratic equations: factorization, completing the squares, graphs and the quadratic formula. Each method has its own limitations. A method that will work for almost every quadratic equation is the quadratic formula. We define it as follows: If ax2+bx+c=0 is a quadratic equation, then the value of x is given by the formula:

The quantity in the square root is called the discriminant or D. If it is positive the quadratic has two distinct real number solutions, if it is zero it has repeated real number solutions and if it is negative neither of the solutions are real numbers.

In this experiment a function will be written to calculate the discriminant of a quadratic equation. It will be overloaded to print a description of the discriminant. Another function will be written to calculate the real repeated roots or the real and distinct roots of a quadratic equation. Finally, a program will be written to solve multiple quadratic equations based on user selection.
  
The purpose of this report is to present the functions and program developed to solve the problem outlined above.
