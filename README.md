# The-Roots-of-a-Quadratic-Equation
The contents of this repository were taken form a lab report I submitted for the course Programing for Engineering.

Problem Statement

There are four main methods for solving quadratic equations: factorization, completing the squares, graphs and the quadratic formula. Each method has its own limitations. A method that will work for almost every quadratic equation is the quadratic formula. We define it as follows: If ax2+bx+c=0 is a quadratic equation, then the value of x is given by the formula:

x=(-b±√(b^2-4ac))/2a

The quantity in the square root is called the discriminant or D. If it is positive the quadratic has two distinct real number solutions, if it is zero it has repeated real number solutions and if it is negative neither of the solutions are real numbers.

	In this experiment a function will be written to calculate the discriminant of a quadratic equation. It will be overloaded to print a description of the discriminant. Another function will be written to calculate the real repeated roots or the real and distinct roots of a quadratic equation. Finally, a program will be written to solve multiple quadratic equations based on user selection.
  
	 The purpose of this report is to present the functions and program developed to solve the problem outlined above. 

Conclusion

In conclusion, functions were developed to find and describe the discriminant of a quadratic equation and solve for its roots if they are real number solutions. A program was also developed which could solve multiple quadratic equations based on user selection. Once the problem was divided up into specific tasks that could be solved by different functions, it made the program easier to write and the solution clearer. It was also observed that equations with imaginary roots could not be solved. Although it was not mentioned in the original problem, this program could be adjusted to output imaginary or complex roots for equations that have no real number solutions.
